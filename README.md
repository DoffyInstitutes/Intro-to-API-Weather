Weather in City Tracker

Project Description: This program takes in the input of a user's city and uses the free OpenWeatherMap API to give the client specific data about the temperature, what the temperature actually feels like, humidity levels, windspeed, and more. 
I used the OpenWeatherMap API because it is a user-friendly API that will introduce me to how I can use APIs properly, including using the Requests library to work with the API to get necessary information. 
Some challenges I faced were going through the original dicitionary from the API and figuring out how I can print the key information. 


Additional note: This is my first time using GitHub. This is also my first real use of an API, as this is practice for me to work on projects that will implement the Spotify API or the Hearthstone API.
